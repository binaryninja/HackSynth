## 2. Summary
- **Problem Statement:** Traditional penetration testing is labor-intensive and struggles to scale with increasing cyber threats. There is a pressing need for autonomous agents capable of intelligently and safely performing penetration testing.
- **Main Contributions:**  
  • Introduction of HackSynth, an autonomous penetration testing agent composed of a dual-module architecture (Planner and Summarizer).  
  • Proposal of two standardized CTF-based benchmarks using PicoCTF and OverTheWire environments, comprising 200 diverse challenges.  
  • Extensive experimental evaluation of key LLM parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p, token limits), safety, and performance across several both open-source and proprietary LLMs.
- **Key Findings:**  
  • The dual-module architecture allows iterative command generation and summarization, offering effective progress toward capturing flags.  
  • Parameter optimization (observation window, temperature, and top-p settings) significantly influences performance, with optimal results at moderate settings.  
  • GPT-4o achieved the highest performance among tested models, surpassing expectations based on its system card.
- **Methodology Overview:** HackSynth operates by alternating between a Planner module (command generation) and a Summarizer module (state tracking and context management), running commands in an isolated, containerized Kali Linux environment secured by external firewall rules.
- **Conclusion:** HackSynth demonstrates the potential for autonomous LLM-based agents in penetration testing by effectively solving a variety of CTF challenges, while emphasizing the need for robust safety measures and further modular improvements.

## 3. Background & Related Work
- **Prior Work Referenced:**  
  • Traditional heuristic-based penetration testing tools such as Nessus, Snyk, and OpenVAS.  
  • Earlier LLM-based approaches like PentestGPT, HackingBuddyGPT, AutoAttacker, Enigma, and other autonomous hacking agents.
- **How It Differs from Existing Research:**  
  • Implements a fully autonomous workflow that minimizes human intervention by iteratively planning and summarizing actions.  
  • Introduces standardized benchmarks to reliably compare LLM-based agents.
- **Gaps It Addresses:**  
  • Lack of standardized evaluation datasets for autonomous penetration testing.  
  • Limited understanding of underlying decision mechanisms and safety considerations of current LLM-based cyber agents.

## 4. Methodology
- **Approach Taken:**  
  • Development of HackSynth with a dual-module architecture (Planner for command generation and Summarizer for aggregating responses).
- **Key Techniques Used:**  
  • Prompt engineering for both planning and summarization with explicit system and user prompts.  
  • Parameter optimization (temperature, top-p, observation window) to balance creativity with reliable output.
- **Datasets / Benchmarks Used:**  
  • Two new CTF benchmarks constructed from PicoCTF and OverTheWire challenges, totaling 200 tasks across multiple cybersecurity domains.
- **Implementation Details:**  
  • Commands are executed in a containerized Kali Linux environment with strict network and file system restrictions.  
  • Detailed logging of the iterative planning-summarization process ensures historical context for decision making.
- **Reproducibility:**  
  • Code and benchmarks are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/aielte-research/HackSynth) and include solver functions to dynamically adapt to changing challenge flags and environments.

## 5. Experimental Evaluation
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  • Number of correctly solved challenges per benchmark, average time per challenge, error rate in command generation, and token utilization.
- **Results Summary:**  
  • GPT-4o solved the highest number of challenges; other models like Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2-72B showed competitive performance in specific scenarios.  
  • Parameter studies revealed that moderate observation windows (e.g., 250 characters for PicoCTF, 500 for OverTheWire), temperature settings at or below 1, and fine-tuned top-p values yield optimal outcomes.
- **Baseline Comparisons:**  
  • Performance comparison was conducted across eight LLM models including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, various Llama versions, Qwen2-72B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Phi series models.
- **Ablation Studies:**  
  • Analysis of the impact of temperature variation, top-p sampling, and observation window sizes on challenge completion and error rates.
- **Limitations Noted by **Authors:****  
  • Occasional command hallucination (e.g., targeting unintended IP addresses), repetitive strategies leading to "rabbit holes," and risk of destabilizing the testing environment were observed.
