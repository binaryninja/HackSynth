## 2. Summary
- **Problem Statement:** Traditional penetration testing is labor-intensive and relies heavily on human expertise. There is a growing need to develop scalable and autonomous solutions to efficiently identify vulnerabilities across complex systems.
- **Main Contributions:** 
  • Introduction of HackSynth, an autonomous penetration testing agent with a dual-module architecture (Planner and Summarizer) for iterative command generation and feedback processing.  
  • Creation and public release of two standardized CTF-based benchmarks (PicoCTF and OverTheWire) comprising 200 challenges across various cybersecurity domains.  
  • Extensive experimental evaluations and parameter tuning (e.g., temperature, top-p, observation window) to establish guidelines for safe and effective autonomous penetration testing.
- **Key Findings:**  
  • GPT-4o performed best among the tested LLMs, outmatching performance expectations suggested by its own documentation.  
  • Optimal performance relies on careful calibration of parameters like the observation window, temperature (optimal ≤1), and top-p sampling.  
  • Iterative interaction between the planner and summarizer modules is crucial for cumulative progress; however, certain models may lock into nonproductive strategies.
- **Methodology Overview:** The system uses a feedback loop between a Planner module (responsible for generating terminal-executable commands within a containerized Kali Linux environment) and a Summarizer module (which maintains a concise history of actions and outputs). This architecture iteratively guides the agent through CTF challenges while applying safety measures (e.g., firewall rules) to restrict potentially unsafe behavior.
- **Conclusion:** HackSynth demonstrates the potential of LLM-based autonomous agents in penetration testing, offering a promising alternative to manual assessments. The benchmarks and code repository have been released to support further research in autonomous cybersecurity solutions, while also spotlighting the need for rigorous safety protocols.

## 3. Background & Related Work
- **Prior Work Referenced:** PentestGPT, HackingBuddyGPT, AutoAttacker, Enigma, Katana, Remenissions, and various CTF-based datasets (e.g., NYU CTF, Intercode CTF).
- **How It Differs from Existing Research:** Unlike previous approaches that often relied on semi-autonomous systems or limited interactions, HackSynth fully automates the penetration testing process by leveraging a dual-module system and standardized benchmarks. It also emphasizes a comprehensive analysis of model parameters and safety measures.
- **Gaps It Addresses:** It provides insights into the internal decision-making of autonomous agents, quantifies key operational parameters, and proposes standardized benchmarks to evaluate penetration testing performance more reliably.

## 4. Methodology
- **Approach Taken:** The paper introduces a feedback-loop architecture where the Planner generates commands based on a dynamic, summarized history of previous actions, and the Summarizer condenses command outputs to maintain context.
- **Key Techniques Used:** Iterative LLM-based planning and summarization; dynamic prompt engineering; parameter optimization (temperature, top-p, observation window window sizing); containerized execution with security constraints.
- **Datasets / Benchmarks Used:** Two curated benchmark sets derived from PicoCTF (120 challenges) and OverTheWire (80 challenges), covering domains such as web exploitation, cryptography, reverse engineering, forensics, and binary exploitation.
- **Implementation Details:**  
  • Commands are executed within a containerized Kali Linux environment with firewall restrictions to prevent unauthorized interactions.  
  • Interaction is managed via placeholders (e.g., {summarized_history}, {new_observation}) that update the LLM’s context iteratively.  
  • Evaluation involves both open-source LLMs (like Llama-3.1 variants, Phi-3-mini) and proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini).
- **Reproducibility:** The authors provide a detailed description of the system and parameter tuning, along with standardized benchmarks. The code is publicly available via GitHub, enhancing reproducibility.

## 5. Experimental Evaluation

  • Number of challenges completed per benchmark  
  • Error rates in command generation  
  • Token usage (input and output over iterative steps)  
  • Average time per challenge
- **Results Summary:** GPT-4o solved the most challenges on both benchmarks. Experiments highlighted how lower temperatures (≤1) yield more reliable command outputs and that the optimal observation window size is crucial to balance context and avoid information overload.
- **Baseline Comparisons:** The performance of HackSynth was compared across various models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.1-8B/70B, Qwen2-72B) with GPT-4o emerging as the best performer.
- **Ablation Studies:** Conducted on key parameters including temperature, top-p values, and observation window sizes to understand their impact on performance and safe behavior.
- **Limitations Noted by **Authors:**** The agent occasionally exhibits unexpected or repetitive strategies (e.g., command hallucinations, "rabbit hole" behaviors) that may lead to unintended interactions. There are inherent risks in deploying fully autonomous agents that must be tightly controlled to avoid damaging behaviors.

## 6. Strengths

- **Impact & Potential Applications:** Offers significant implications for automating cybersecurity tasks and improving the speed and scalability of vulnerability assessments.

## 7. Weaknesses & Critiques
- **Unaddressed Assumptions / Flaws:**  
  • Potential risks associated with unexpected behaviors (e.g., scanning unintended IP addresses).  
  • Relies heavily on the controlled benchmark setting rather than real-world scenarios.
- **Possible Biases or Limitations:**  
  • Benchmark datasets may not cover all types of cybersecurity challenges encountered in practice.  
  • Limited discussion on how to prevent adversarial exploitation of the LLM agent in uncontrolled environments.
- **Reproducibility Concerns:**  
  • Resource intensity of experiments may limit replication without access to comparable computational resources.
- **Presentation Issues:** While detailed, some sections are dense and may benefit from clearer summarization for broader accessibility.

## Introduction
<img align="left" style="width: 160px;" src="assets/logo.gif" alt="HackSynth Logo"/>

We introduce HackSynth, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent capable of autonomous penetration testing.
HackSynth's dual-module architecture includes a Planner and a Summarizer, which enable it to generate commands and process feedback iteratively. 
To benchmark HackSynth, we propose two new Capture The Flag (CTF)-based benchmark sets utilizing the popular platforms PicoCTF and OverTheWire. 
These benchmarks include two hundred challenges across diverse domains and difficulties, providing a standardized framework for evaluating LLM-based penetration testing agents.
