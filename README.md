## 2. Summary
- **Problem Statement:** Traditional penetration testing relies on manual, expert-driven processes that do not scale well in modern complex network environments. There is an urgent need for autonomous, adaptable, and robust cybersecurity solutions that can mimic human problem‐solvers.
- **Main Contributions:** 
  - Introduction of HackSynth, an autonomous LLM-based penetration testing agent with a dual-module architecture (Planner and Summarizer).
  - Proposal of two standardized CTF benchmarking datasets based on PicoCTF and OverTheWire challenges.
  - Extensive experiments on parameter tuning (e.g., temperature, top-p, observation window size) and comparative evaluation using multiple LLM models.
- **Key Findings:** 
  - A careful balance of parameters (e.g., temperature ≤ 1, optimizing the new observation window size) is critical to maintaining performance and reliability.
  - GPT-4o outperforms other models, efficiently solving a significant portion of CTF challenges.
  - The agent’s iterative approach allows it to accumulate context and adapt its strategy over multiple cycles.
- **Methodology Overview:** 
  - Constructing an autonomous agent that alternates between generating commands (Planner module) and summarizing outputs (Summarizer module) within a secure, containerized Kali Linux environment.
  - Utilizing standardized, dynamic CTF benchmarks supplemented with heuristic solver scripts to adapt to changing flag values and challenge conditions.
- **Conclusion:** HackSynth demonstrates that integrating LLM-based planning with summarization can effectively automate penetration testing tasks, though robust safety measures and further enhancements are necessary to manage risks in real-world deployments.

## 3. Background & Related Work
- **Prior Work Referenced:** 
  - Traditional vulnerability scanning tools (Nessus, Snyk, OpenVas)
  - Other LLM-based penetration testing agents (PentestGPT, HackingBuddyGPT, AutoAttacker, Enigma)
- **How It Differs from Existing Research:** 
  - Unlike previous systems that depended on human intervention for key tasks, HackSynth is designed to operate in a fully autonomous fashion.
  - Introduces a dual-module architecture that continuously feeds summarized output back into the decision process.
  - Establishes standardized benchmarks with dynamic solver functions to account for variability in challenge solutions.
- **Gaps It Addresses:** 
  - Lack of understanding regarding the decision-making processes and potential vulnerabilities of LLM-driven agents.
  - Absence of standardized, reproducible benchmarks for evaluating the performance of autonomous penetration testing agents.

## 4. Methodology
- **Approach Taken:** 
  - Develop a two-module system where the Planner generates bash commands (wrapped in <CMD></CMD> tags) based on a dynamic summary of previous actions, while the Summarizer condenses outputs into actionable context.
- **Key Techniques Used:** 
  - Iterative planning and summarization
  - Parameter optimization (temperature, top-p, observation window size)
  - Containerization with firewall restrictions for safe command execution
- **Datasets / Benchmarks Used:** 
  - Two CTF-based benchmarks: one from PicoCTF (120 challenges) and another from OverTheWire (80 challenges), covering multiple cybersecurity domains.
- **Implementation Details:** 
  - Command generation and parsing via detailed system and user prompts.
  - Use of heuristic solver scripts to dynamically update correct solutions and flag retrieval.
  - Safe operation enforced through environmental isolation and network whitelisting.
- **Reproducibility:** 
  - Code and benchmarks are publicly available on GitHub which aids in reproducibility.
  - Detailed experimental protocols and prompt scripts are provided in the paper’s appendix.

## 5. Experimental Evaluation
- **Evaluation Metrics:** 
  - Number of completed challenges, average time per challenge, error rate in command generation, and token usage statistics.
- **Results Summary:** 
  - GPT-4o achieved the highest performance (41/120 PicoCTF and 32/80 OverTheWire challenges), with balanced token usage and fastest average completion time.
  - Ablation studies showed that improper parameter settings (e.g., high temperature > 1 or too large observation window) can lead to increased error rates and degraded performance.
- **Baseline Comparisons:** 
  - Performance compared across several models including Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-4o-mini, Mixtral-8x7B, Qwen2-72B, Phi-3-mini, and Phi-3.5-MoE.
- **Ablation Studies:** 
  - Extensive experiments on the effect of key parameters (temperature, top-p, new observation window size).
- **Limitations Noted by **Authors:**** 
  - Occasional unexpected behavior, such as command hallucination (e.g., scanning unintended IP addresses) and repetitive strategies leading to “rabbit holes.”
  - Challenges in ensuring all safety measures prevent unintended system modifications.

## Introduction
<img align="left" style="width: 160px;" src="assets/logo.gif" alt="HackSynth Logo"/>

We introduce HackSynth, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent capable of autonomous penetration testing.
HackSynth's dual-module architecture includes a Planner and a Summarizer, which enable it to generate commands and process feedback iteratively. 
To benchmark HackSynth, we propose two new Capture The Flag (CTF)-based benchmark sets utilizing the popular platforms PicoCTF and OverTheWire. 
These benchmarks include two hundred challenges across diverse domains and difficulties, providing a standardized framework for evaluating LLM-based penetration testing agents.
